## ðŸ’¡ **JUDGE Q&A - PREPARED ANSWERS**

### **Q: "How is this different from existing cybersecurity tools?"**
**A:** "We combine traditional SIEM capabilities with blockchain verification for tamper-proof audit trails, plus AI-powered threat detection. Most tools are either traditional OR blockchain-focused, but we bridge both worlds."

### **Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. We have proper authentication, database integration, error handling, and a scalable architecture. The codebase follows enterprise standards with TypeScript, modular components, and comprehensive API design."

### **Q: "What's the blockchain component?"**
**A:** "Every security log is cryptographically hashed and can be anchored to Polygon blockchain for immutable audit trails. This prevents tampering and ensures regulatory compliance."

### **Q: "How does the AI detection work?"**
**A:** "We analyze patterns in user behavior, network traffic, and system events to score threats in real-time. The ML models continuously learn from new threat intelligence."

### **Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
**A:** "Target mid-to-large enterprises that need SOC 2 compliance and want next-gen security. SaaS model with tiered pricing based on organization size and features needed."
